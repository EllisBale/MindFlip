## 2. Design


### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq Wireframes to help structure the wireframes before and during the design of the website. This helped me plan the design of the website by helping me apply the layout and the navigation. Using the software is good for designing layouts on different devices so that I can implement them later on.

## 5. Testing & Bugs



### HTML validation

To test my html code validation I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)  by direct input. This let's me see what errors I have such as unwanted elements.
